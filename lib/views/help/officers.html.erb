  responses to requests.  Please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> if we've
  missed one.
  For technical reasons we don't always remove them from attachments, such as certain PDFs.</p>
  <p>If you need to know what an address was that we've removed, please <a
    href="<%= help_contact_path %>">get in touch with us</a>. Occasionally, an email address
  forms an important part of a response and we will post it up in an obscured
  form in an annotation.
