On AskyourGov.ug, only your name is visible to the general public unless you put other personal information in the
body of the request.
</p>
<p>
We strongly advise you not to put any personal information in the body of the request. That includes not putting your
phone number, home address, email address or other personal or family or work details. You don’t need to give any of
this information in order to exercise your right to information.
</p>
<p>
If a Ugandan public Official needs to speak with you by phone to clarify the request, you should send your number to
them directly and not via this platform.

<dt id="email_address">Who gets to see my email address? <!-- <a href="#email_address">#</a>--> </dt>

<dd>
<p>
Your e-mail address will not be shown on the website unless you include in the message or in a footer to your email.
</p>
<p>We will not disclose your email address to anyone unless we are obliged to by law,
or you ask us to. This includes the public agencies that you are sending requests to. They only get to see an email address
@<%= AlaveteliConfiguration::incoming_email_domain %> which is specific to that request.</p>
<p>If you send a message to another user on the site, then it will reveal your
email address to them. You will be told that this is going to happen.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="nasty_spam">Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address? <!-- <a href="#nasty_spam">#</a> --> </dt>
<dd>No! After you sign up to <%= site_name %> we will only send you emails
relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up for,
or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never give or
sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law, or
you ask us to.
</dd>

<dt id="public_request">Why will my name and my request appear publicly on the site? </dt>

<dd>
<p>We publish your request on the Internet so that anybody can read it and
make use of the information that you have found. We do not normally delete
requests (<a href="#delete_requests">more details</a>).
</p>
<p>
Your name is part of your request, so has to be published as well.
It is only fair, as we're going to publish the name of the civil servant who
writes the response to your request. By law, you must use your real name for the request to be a valid ATI request.
</p>
<p>Using your real name also helps people get in touch with you to assist you with your research or to campaign with you.</p>
</dd>


<dt id="real_name">Can I make an ATI request using a pseudonym? </dt>

<dd>
<p>You are advised to use your real name when making an access to documents request. You are exercising a right which is
the basis for an open and democratic society and this should be under your real name.</p>

<p>If you feel that your name is very well known – for example you are a famous person or well known journalist – you
might want to get a friend or colleague to file the request. If you are really stuck, contact us and we will try to help
you file the request; please note that we don’t have the resources to do this for everyone.</p>

<p>Please note that if you use a pseudonym, you will not be able to exercise your legal right to appeal to the
Court of Law.</p>
<p>We ask for a first and a last name. If you have more than one first or last name you can use these, but the minimum
is a first and last name.</p>
<p>If we see silly names or really obvious pseudonyms, we will remove the request and contact the requester about this.</p>
<p>Please do not impersonate someone else!</p>

<dt id="full_address">They've asked for my postal address! <a href="#full_address">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>If a public authority asks you for your full, physical address, reply to them saying
that section 8.1.b of the FOI Act asks for an "address for correspondence",
and that the email address you are using is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
The Ministry of Justice has <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/foi-procedural-what.htm">guidance
on this</a> &ndash;
<em>"As well as hard copy written correspondence, requests that are
transmitted electronically (for example, in emails) are acceptable
... If a request is received by email and no postal address is given, the email
address should be treated as the return address."
</em>
</p>
<p>As if that isn't enough, the Information Commissioner's
<a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/practical_application/foi_hints_for_practitioners_handing_foi_and_eir_requests_2008_final.pdf">Hints for Practitioners</a> say
<em>"Any correspondence could include a request for information. If it is written (this includes e-mail), legible, gives the name of the applicant, an address for reply (which could be electronic), and includes a description of the information required, then it will fall within the scope of the legislation."</em>
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="postal_answer">No no, they need a postal address to send a paper response! <a href="#postal_answer">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you want,
they may ask you for a postal address. To start with, try persuading them
to scan in the documents for you. You can even <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532">offer to gift them a scanner</a>, which in that particular case
embarrassed the authority into finding one they had already.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, and you want to provide your postal address privately
in order to receive the documents, mark your request as "They are going to reply by post", and it will
give you an email address to use for that purpose.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="delete_requests">Can you delete my requests, or alter my name? </dt>

<dd>
<p><%= site_name %> is a permanent, public archive of Freedom of
Information requests. Even though you may not find the response to
a request useful any more, it may be of interest to others. For this
reason, we will not delete requests.
</p>

<p>Under exceptional circumstances we may remove or change your name
on the website, <a href="#takedown">see the next question</a>.
Similarly, we may also remove other personal information.
</p>

</dd>

<!--
<dt id="takedown">Can you take down personal information about me? <a href="#takedown">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>If you see any personal information about you on the site which you'd like
us to remove or hide, then please <a href="/help/contact">let us know</a>.
Specify exactly what information you believe to be problematic and why, and
where it appears on the site.</p>

<p>If it is sensitive personal information that has been accidentally
posted, then we will usually remove it. Normally we will only consider
requests to remove personal information which come from the individual
concerned, but for sensitive information we would appreciate anyone
pointing out anything they see.</p>

<p>We consider that there is a strong public interest in
retaining the names of officers or servants of public authorities. We will only
remove such names in exceptional circumstances, such as where the disclosure of
a name and position of employment would substantially risk an individual's
safety. If you are such an official and you wish to have your name removed for
such an urgent reason, you must supply us with a request to do so from your
line manager. This request must demonstrate that a risk has been perceived
which outweighs the public interest, and must demonstrate that efforts have
been made to conceal the name on the organisation's own website.</p>

<p>For all other requests we apply a public interest test to decide
whether information should be removed.
<a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=3190650"> Section 32</a>
of the Data Protection Act 1998 permits us to do this, as the material we
publish is journalistic. We cannot easily edit many types of attachments (such
as PDFs, or Microsoft Word or Excel files), so we will usually ask
that authorities resend these with the personal information removed.</p>
